### metadata.json

- Provides the hierarchical structure of locations (Region → Province → City)
- Lists available hotline types and categories
- Tracks total number of hotlines
- Maintains last update timestamp
- Makes contribution easier by providing a clear data structure

### hotlines.json

- Contains the comprehensive hotline data
- Each entry includes:
  - Unique ID
  - Location information (region, province, city)
  - Contact details with alternate numbers
  - Service categorization
  - Availability information
  - Active status tracking

   - Images and static resources
2. Stale-while-revalidate strategy for fresh content
3. Offline fallback page
4. Persistent data storage
